# S-P-500-stock-analysis-and-predictions

My project revolves around S&P 500 companies. The aim is to get the stock price data.I'll manipulate and visualize the data and attempt to come up with a strategy for investing in companies, thereby apply some regression techniques, basic machine learning algorithms,time series forecasting,some deep learning, and then learn how to back-test a strategy. For achieving the above mentioned aim, I divided my project into respective stages

Stage 1 - Web Scraping wikipedia to get the 500 tickers and then scraping the yahoo finance website to get the stock prices of all 500 companies

Stage 2 - combining all the ['Adj Close'] data and Volume data of every company in one data frame in order to do data cleaning and pre processing

Stage 3 - Visualize the data using heat maps and then creating a correlation table/matrix of the entire dataset

Stage 4 - Creating the targets for machine learning labels and apply machine learning algorithms

Stage 5 - Applying machine Learning to predict the stock prices and the overall accuracy using various machine learning algorithms
